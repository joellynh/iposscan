Description: The iposscan package contains functions that accesses the scans the IPOS API and automates common tasks and analyses done on IP (particularly patents) data. 
        The first few functions retrieve IP (especially patent) data by application lodgement date(s) and parses it into dataframes that are raw and cleaned.
        The last few functions provides users with a quick scan through the patent applications between two lodgement dates, and provides an insight into similar patents (by invention title) and a data visualization of where applicants and inventors of the patents are from in the world.
